# Milestone-2
GIMM 350 at Boise State University

Gathered assets to use as placeholders in game creation.  Have found a wonderful FREE morgue
scene to use for my game, which I am beyond excited about.  I unfortunately will either
need to 3D model the various tools to use in the game for the player to hold, or shell out
some money in order to purchase pre-made assets that come with textures.  Leaning towards
the former.

For my game, my plan for using each asset is as follows:
Morgue scene will function as the background for the entire level.
Female asset will act as the cadaver that will be worked on.
Tools (when I'm able to purchase or make them) will be what the player will use to perform
their opperations and tasks.

I believe these assets to be the most important in order to make this level of my game work
as I would like it to.  Anything else that I add will merely be for story fluff.


Section V in Unity Games by Tutorials (Tower Defense).
The completed working code and game have been uploaded to github, with VR support.  I did not
see in the milestone bullets where it was required to support VR... But the students at the worklab
today were quite insistent that it had to be.  So.. ta-dah, I guess?

Things I changed:

- Created Fairy Tower, which is a new defense tower that the player can now purchae.
- Modified a 3D model found on the asset store by outfitting it with a new texture--More pink!
- Created a fairyProjectile prefab and script, which lets the Fairy Tower will send out to attack
enemies.
- Imported and modified particle effects, which were added to the tower and the fairyProjectile,
to signify fairies coming out of tower to attack the enemies.  The particles are gradual, and begin
to "swarm" the enemies over time.
- Created a fairy game button that can now be chosen from the menu options when purchasing
a tower.
- Updated UIManager and TowerManager scripts to implement new tower into the game when purchased.
- Added annoying Navi "Hey Listen!" sound effects whenever the tower sends out fairies to attack.

I am unsure what the "update on my timeline" objective for this milestone is.  I'm assuming that it
is in regards to trello.  Therefore, I have updated my trello page to reflect the changes I have made,
as well as to add new objectives for the next milestone.  The board has also been updated to reflect 
what has been done, what isn't done, and what I'm in the midst of working on right now.
